# Rust Exercises - Taller 1 FIUBA

Welcome to our collection of Rust exercises, inspired by the challenges presented in [Taller 1 FIUBA Rust](https://taller-1-fiuba-rust.github.io/guias/guia1.html). This repository is designed to help you improve your Rust programming skills through practical, hands-on exercises.

## About the Exercises

Each exercise in this repository is sourced from the Taller 1 FIUBA Rust guide. These exercises are introductory in nature, focusing on the fundamentals of the Rust programming language. They are designed to provide a solid foundation for those new to Rust, making them ideal for beginners or programmers transitioning from other languages who wish to get acquainted with Rust's unique features and syntax.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the Rust programming language installed on your system. If you haven't installed Rust yet, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
